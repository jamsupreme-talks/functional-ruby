# Fun[ctional] Ruby

Mulling over how we could bring some functional practices into Ruby and pondering why we would want to do that.

# Tentative agenda

- Pixie Procs (fancy chain-able procs)
- Names for "Higher order functions"
  - Pipe
  - Pipeline
  - Pipework
  - PipeTrait (module mixins)
- Reasons we want "functional" code
  - Simplified readability
  - Simplified testing
  - Easy to enforce an obvious convention
  - Once the latter, easy to develop cross-cutting concerns
